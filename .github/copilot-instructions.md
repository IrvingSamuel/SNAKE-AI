## Snake AI Game Project
This project implements a Snake game with a neural network AI that learns to play using reinforcement learning. Features include:
- Real-time visualization of the AI learning process
- Training metrics and performance graphs
- Interface similar to "Universo Programado" YouTube channel
- PyGame for game graphics
- PyTorch for neural network implementation

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the game: python main.py
3. Choose from interactive menu or use command line arguments

## Project Structure Complete
All components implemented and tested successfully.
